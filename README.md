# Multi Aspect Sentiment Analysis of Bibit Using Indobert

Rapid technological developments and emerging applications can facilitate and provide solutions to
problems. One of them is an application that can facilitate investment transactions. An investor no
longer needs to visit the location of an investment company to make an investment. Investors can
carry out all investment transactions through the smartphone screen. Bibit is an investment
application that can help investors invest in mutual funds. There are many reviews submitted by
users every day, therefore an aspect-based sentiment analysis is needed to identify the aspects and
user sentiments of each review. Sentiment analysis based on a review of aspects of the Bibit
application will be carried out in this study using the BERT method with IndoBERT who has been
previously trained. The results of the classification of multi-aspect sentiment analysis showed that
the highest accuracy was achieved by the service aspect at 92%, the user satisfaction aspect was
87%, and the lowest accuracy was achieved by the system aspect at 75%. Based on the sentiment
analysis results, companies can improve aspects of the Bibit application system and services to
provide better services & functionality.
